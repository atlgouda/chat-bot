# ExtraHop UI Take-Home Code Question
## Gouda Clark's submission

Comments are included in main.js file to describe code.

### Class-Based Solution
An assumption for username is that no colons can be included (due to slicing message on ":" character)

I did not include a fomal test, but if you run main.test.js, you should see an example of desired return.  I used the first verse and chorus lyrics to the song "Party Hard", as I was looking for a message text that had multiple words repeated frequently. I included two runs of generateTopTenMessage() to verify that the results would clear after each run.
